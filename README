wingalingding
==============================

What is it?
-----------------------------

The underlying concept is simple.  Have you ever wanted to find all of the box drawing
unicode symbols without wanting to go online and look through various crappy resources
to find them?  Maybe you'd like to do something with them programmatically, but that 
first involes either scraping information about the characters from online, or knowing
the range in which they exist throughout the unicode map, and accessing them programmatically.

Wingadingling is a very simple gem that aims to make processes like these simpler.

Description goes here.


How to use it?
-------------------------------

It's pretty eff-ing easy.  If you want to print all box drawing characters, along with
their unicode address, you can just do:

```
require 'wingadingling'

# display prints in a fancy line-drawn box, instead of just vomiting up results
puts Wingalingding::Char.display("DRAWINGS")

```

If you want to see what the most ubiquitous character classes/alphabets are in unicode,
just check


```
require 'wingadingling'

puts Wingalingding::CATEGORIES

```

If you want to do anything with characters matching whatever search term you come up with,
try

```
require 'wingadingling'

puts Wingalingding::Char.find("tree")

```

That's about it for now.  Oh yeah - it also comes with a binary called "wing", that gives you quick access to this
stuff/

```
wing "snowman"

```

Enjoy.
